//! Year-specific modules for tax calculation quirks and overrides.
//!
//! Most year-specific logic is handled through the `TaxRules` trait
//! implementations in the `rules` module. This module contains any
//! additional year-specific behavior that doesn't fit the rules pattern.

// Future years can add modules here for any special handling needed.
// Example:
// pub mod y2026;
